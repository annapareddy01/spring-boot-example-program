@RequestParam

incase of @PathVariable we should pass the data. but in 
@RequestParam it is not mandatory.
we can achieve this using require attribute.

Note : when we pass require attribute it will provide dafault value has null.

but instead of reading null value we can provide our own user defined default value using 
defaultValue as property.
